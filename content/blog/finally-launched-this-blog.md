I can tweak EVERYTHING. And as a developer, that's immensely satisfying.

This blog-post isn't long. In fact, it's ridiculously short. It's purpose is clear

as a blue sky:

> Finally I have my own online home, where I can share my process as a\
> creator, learn in public, release technologies, projects, products, and \
> help others grow creatively too.

P.S. At the time of writing this, it's the Coronapocalyse out there.\
Wash your hands. Stay at home. Save lives.

To prospering in good times and challenging times,
